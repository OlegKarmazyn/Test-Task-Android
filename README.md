# Test-Task-Android

<b>Necessary requirements</b> <br>
<p>Install Android Studio
<p>Create a Git account (git hub/git lab/ bitbucket etc.)
<p>Follow one code style, same naming for fields, classes, files, ids, etc.
<p>Create a specific branch for each level of exercise and push it separately
<p>Git tree should look like this : 
<p>|----- develop (no any classes only settings.gradle and build.gradle)
<p>|---------- level_1 (Solutions for level 1)
<p>|---------- level_2 (Solutions for level 2)
<p>|---------- level_n (Solutions for level n)
<p>You can’t jump over a level, only step by step
<p>You need to decide what you can do, Junior, Middle or Senior for each level and give only one solution
<p>You should create a package where you will upload all APK files – it means when you are done with level 1 exercise, push it and after it create APK and upload into a specific package in the git
